# Impressions of the Times
An AI paints the New York Times headline.

Twice a day, an AI creates abstract art based on the lead story from the New York Times and posts it to Twitter. The AI presents news images not as photographs, but as modernist paintings, a medium associated with highbrow entertainment in museums and galleries, not with reporting. 

The paintings aim to abstract away the realism of the news in the same way that stories of far-off wars and famines appear as theoretical events that draw our passing interest. The paintings emphasize the frequent disconnect between real news events and our daily lives. Like art, news is often treated as something to look at, something to catch our interest, and perhaps something to discuss over dinner.

The abstract paintings ask us to interrogate the role of journalism in our lives. Do we consume news only for information or also for its ability to entertain and distract us?
